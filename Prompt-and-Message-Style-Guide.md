### General
* Try to keep prompt and message text close to how it is written on the cards.
* No need to reference card names in prompts since the card name is always listed at the top of the prompt window.

### Terminology
* Use "choose" over "select" or "target".
* Use "counter" instead of "token". Advancement tokens have been renamed to advancement counters by Nisei
* Capitalize 
  * Sides (Runner, Corp) 
  * Card names (Hedge Fund)
  * Central servers (Archives, R&D, HQ).
* Do not capitalize 
  * Card types, subtypes, or other keywords (ice, agenda, bioroid, hardware, virus counter, etc.).
  * Do not capitalize Runner zones (grip, heap)
* When referring to ice, use "this ice" for self reference and "piece of ice" when referring to another card.
* When describing the state of a piece of ice, put the description in front of "piece" (i.e. unrezzed piece of ice)

### Using symbols
* Use "MU" instead of the MU symbol for any non-gain text (i.e. Cortex Lock)
