Rough ideas:
 - Import from Cobra
 - Create lobbies for each pairing
 - Start button to make all games start simultaneously
 - TO can set options for all games in the tournament
 - Some way to send a message to each lobby
 - Bind/map cobra names to jnet user names, restrict joining a lobby to those who are within the game
 - TO creates a lobby: generate lobby code that players use to see the games.
 - To join a tournament, players choose 2 tournament-format legal decks, which are locked in.
 - Deck lists have a checksum for verification and enforcing no changes
 - Checkbox for streamers that gives them access as spectators
 - Some method for the TO to ping players, idk how exactly lol
 - And make sure cobra player name comparison is case insensitive
