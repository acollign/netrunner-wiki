Welcome to the Jinteki.net open-source progress report Fall 2015. In this quarterly report, we will highlight some of the recent changes to the Jinteki.net Android: Netrunner platform.

#### About Jinteki.net

[Jinteki.net](http://www.jinteki.net) is a service for playing Android: Netrunner in a browser. It requires no installation to play, is compatible with most operating systems and modern browsers, and includes an interactive deck-builder, chat room, and automation of most game rules and cards.
