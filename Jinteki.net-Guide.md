# Chat

The chat page is where you start on Jinteki.net. General chat is where users discuss cards, site status, and generally connect about playing Netunner. It works like most chat or IRC clients in that you type your message into the box and hit enter to send. There are region specific channels that work well for discussing local events and finding players in your geographic area.

## Chat Tips:
* Ask for help if you are new
* Begin your message with “@username” to indicate that a message is directed at a specific person
* Keep an eye out for posts from MTGred and other contributors about card status updates

# Deckbuilder

The deck builder is an excellent way to quickly create decks either from plain text or from scratch. Begin by selecting the ID, naming your deck, and either copy/pasting the list or adding cards manually from the add card box. Be sure to press the save button when you are done making changes! Be aware that some card names with special characters do not copy and paste well. Déjà vu is the best example, but there may be others. Just add those ones manually.

## Deckbuilder Tips:
* Export your deck list from your site of choice as plain text and copy it right into the deck field
* Decks are sorted by most recently changed, so keep your favorites fresh
* Be sure to delete the deck summary added by most sites, as this will confuse the deck builder

# Gameplay

Jinteki.net gameplay is quite intuitive. Generally clicking on a card will do what you want it to do or give you the options you need. If something doesn’t work or you make a mistake, just adjust resources (credits, clicks, etc.) appropriately and fix the game state. Most actions that can’t be accomplished by clicking on a card can be done by dragging the card image to the appropriate area. If you find a situation that doesn’t fit within the game engine, explain it to your opponent in chat and track it that way.

## Gameplay Tips:

* Be sure to check available resources, especially credits and MU, before trying to install
* Clicking the side of a pop up menu will usually dismiss it
* Try to take recurring credits before doing the action for which they are used

# Etiquette

The Netrunner community has always been an outstanding place to game and Jinteki.net is no exception. Here are a few suggestions to make the online play experience more fun for everyone involved.

* Greet your opponent before starting the game (glhf is traditional)
* Say a farewell before leaving the game (GG is always appreciated)
* Leave a note in general chat for your opponent if you disconnected or had to leave
* Indicate when you are taking a long pause to think so your opponent doesn’t think you disconnected
* Allow your opponent to jack out instead of firing an end the run, unless it would alter the game state
* Check with your opponent before firing subroutines that alter the game state (trash & damage ones especially)
* Inform your opponent of your reasoning before adjusting resources manually
* Avoid complaining about opponents in general chat
* Add a description like, “PRIVATE” to your game if it’s not for anyone to join
* Remember that the site is a free, fan-made endeavor and act accordingly
