Neal: Escher, Crisium Grid, Cerebral Static, access order, steal costs, Film Critic, Shards, hosting performance

Minh: spectating! Jackson, OH & UoT, run credits cleanup

Joel: several Universe of Tomorrow/Data & Destiny cards, bring a few cards to full implementation (Muertos Gang Member, Docklands Crackdown, Executive Boot Camp), fixed cards (Exile, Order of Sol), and of course breaking new ground with more terrible cards that no one uses (Bad Times, Exploratory Romp, Project Ares, Sunset, Nasir Meidan)

MisterMentat (John Honaker): Fixing card names being shown when moved back onto the stack (i.e. Rolodex), fixed nested prompts with choices (May abilities that selected cards), fixed cards that fired on first time events (Hayley, Comet), reworked `:optional` abilities that caused me to briefly break (and then fix) trashing cards and scoring costs. Started working on everyone's favorite identity Jinteki: Replicating Perfection and the associated refactoring of `:register` keys to `:restrictions`.

Justin Liew: Working through all the implications of recurring credits. I think I have a solid design that balances manual payment but enforces proper context/usage. Hopefully will have more to report next month!

Dominic (queueseven): Fixed/improved some cards (i.e. Paintbrush, Datahound, Hostage, Sherlock 1.0 and some others), implemented a bunch of cards (Amazon Industrial Zone, Recruiting Trip, Paige Piper, all Apex cards, Adam, Adam's directives and some others), implemented cloud ice-breakers, improved the message log to show the number of cards in hand and credits when a turn starts or ends, visual indicator when your memory is < 0 and when the runner is tagged. Set up a Trello board to better coordinate our work.
