Neal: Escher, Crisium Grid, Cerebral Static, access order, steal costs, Film Critic, Shards, hosting performance

Minh: spectating! Jackson, OH & UoT, run credits cleanup

Joel: several Universe of Tomorrow/Data & Destiny cards, bring a few cards to full implementation (Muertos Gang Member, Docklands Crackdown, Executive Boot Camp), fixed cards (Exile, Order of Sol), and of course breaking new ground with more terrible cards that no one uses (Bad Times, Exploratory Romp, Project Ares, Nasir Meidan)

MisterMentat (John Honaker): Fixing card names being shown when moved back onto the stack (i.e. Rolodex), fixed nested prompts with choices (May abilities that selected cards), fixed cards that fired on first time events, briefly broke and then fixed trashing cards and scoring costs. Started working on everyone's favorite identity Jinteki: Replicating Perfection and the associated refactoring of `:register` keys to `:restrictions`.
