Jinteki.net could offer some options for TOs to manage their synchronous tournaments (like the NISEI online tournaments).

## Features
* Creation of a number of tables by the TO
* Results from the games are sent directly to the TO
* Players can ask for a judge, which sends a request to the TO and whoever is entered as judge
