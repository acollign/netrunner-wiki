A bit over one year after the last progress report, here's the Jinteki.net open-source progress report for Q2 2019. I'm @lostgeek and have started working on the project since the implementation of Downfall and will try to make these changelogs a more regular thing. I guess that's what the earlier reports also had in mind -- but hey, one can try!

This report will only comprise the recent changes since the last server reboot on May 6th. We'll try to publish these changelogs whenever a new version goes online!
