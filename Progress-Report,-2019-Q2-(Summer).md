A bit over one year after the last progress report, here's the Jinteki.net open-source progress report for Q2 2019. I'm @lostgeek and have started working on the project since the implementation of Downfall and will try to make these changelogs a more regular thing. I guess that's what the earlier reports also had in mind -- but hey, one can try!

This report will only comprise the recent changes since the last server reboot on May 6th. We'll try to publish these changelogs whenever a new version goes online!

# Big Changes
* Costs are now bundled together
  * Whenever more than one type of cost has to be paid, the game now shows a single prompt for all costs to be paid simultaneously. Here's the case of stealing an SDS Drone Deployment from a Server with Ben Musashi and Strongbox.

* Whenever paying a cost, the game now looks at available credit sources and asks whether you want to use them. So for example, whenever you're pumping a breaker with a Cloak and Net Mercur out, the game will now display this:

# Notable Changes
* **Bugfix:** Chat box should now auto-scroll correctly
* **Bugfix:** Deck legality is now displayed correctly together with a reason for illegality
* **Refactoring:** Accessing cards, forced trashing and access abilities were completely reworked. Accessing a Mumbad Virtual Tour should now be possible without any hiccups!
* **New Feature:** Several commands were added for further manual changing of the game state: `/install-ice` `/peek n` `/summon n` `/swap-ice` `/swap-installed` (see help for further information)

# Small Changes
* **Bugfix:** Rejig now applies correct discount
* **Bugfix:** Pelangi now doesn't remove already applied subtypes from the list
* **Bugfix:** ETR and replacement effects are now registering correctly (Giordano ending a run after it is successful doesn't make it unsuccessful...)
* **Bugfix:** Fully Operational now triggers PAD Tap
* **Cleanup:** Director Haas Pet Project is now printing agenda-scored message correctly
* **Bugfix:** CtM triggered on Runner cards
* **Bugfix:** Architect Deployment Test was only working on ICE
* **Bugfix:** Fixed access step for Khusyuk, Top Hat or Information Sifting interacting with Ash or Eater
* **Bugfix:** Fixed Showing Off + Bacterial Programming (turning R&D upside down to be able to use existing routines was a fine idea until BP was printed)
* **Bugfix:** MÃ¶bius is not triggering all the time anymore
* **Bugfix:** Acacia + LLDS Energy Regulator now triggers correctly. Long live the jank!
